## NOTE:

- The zebar is browser app and uses html, css, json files, the problem is if
  these files are inside wsl and the since browser protocols won't allow
  accessing files on a network (wsl falls under this), it's not possible
- So always have the files directly on windows, and paste them in this dotfiles
  repo for saving
